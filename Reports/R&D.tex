\section{Introduction}
Data leak attacks are a significant threat to organizations, as they can result in the exposure of sensitive information and financial loss. Our research and development activities focus on understanding the types of data leaks, methods of attack, and how to detect theme given a network traffic. 

\section{Types of Data Leaks}
Data leaks can occur through various channels, including network traffic, physical devices, and human error. In our research, we focus on network-based data leaks, which involve the unauthorized exfiltration of data through network traffic.

\section{Methods of Attack}

\subsection{Tunneling}
One common method of data leak attack is tunneling, where an attacker establishes a covert channel to exfiltrate data from a secure network. This can be done through various protocols, such as DNS, ICMP, or HTTP, to bypass firewalls and other security measures.

\subsection{Social Engineering}
Social engineering attacks involve manipulating individuals to divulge sensitive information or perform actions that compromise security. Attackers may use phishing emails, phone calls, or other methods to trick employees into revealing passwords or other confidential data.

\subsection{Backdoors and Ports Misuses}
Attackers may exploit backdoors or misuse open ports to gain unauthorized access to a network and exfiltrate data. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware, or using default credentials to gain access to systems.

\section{Data Leak Detection}

\subsection{Packet Inspection}
Packet inspection tools can analyze network traffic to identify suspicious patterns or anomalies that may indicate a data leak. By monitoring packet headers and payloads, these tools can detect unauthorized data transfers and alert security teams to potential threats.

\subsection{User Behavior Analytics (UBA)}
UBA tools analyze user behavior to detect abnormal activities that may indicate a data leak. By monitoring user logins, file access, and other activities, these tools can identify unauthorized access and data exfiltration attempts.

\subsection{Packet Header Analysis}
Packet header analysis tools can examine network traffic to identify data leaks based on packet headers. By analyzing source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and other header fields, these tools can detect suspicious traffic patterns that may indicate a data leak.

\section{Data Leak Attacks Examples}

\subsection{DNS Tunneling}
DNS tunneling attacks involve using DNS queries and responses to exfiltrate data from a secure network. Attackers can encode data in DNS queries or responses and use a malicious DNS server to extract the information.


\subsection{After Hours Data Exfiltration}
After hours data exfiltration attacks involve exfiltrating data from a network when security teams are not actively monitoring traffic. Attackers may schedule data transfers during off-peak hours to avoid detection and increase the chances of success.

\subsection{ports Misuses}
Attackers may misuse open ports to exfiltrate data from a network. By exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware, attackers can gain unauthorized access to systems and exfiltrate sensitive information. one simple example is using port 80 to send data out of the network.


\section{Conclusion}
Data leak attacks pose a significant threat to organizations, as they can result in the exposure of sensitive information and financial loss. Our research and development activities focus on understanding the types of data leaks, methods of attack, and how to detect them using network traffic analysis and other tools. By developing effective detection methods, organizations can protect against data leaks and mitigate the risks associated with these attacks.

\section{Next Steps}
Our next steps will involve the development of a data leak detection tool that will analyze network traffic to identify potential data leaks. We will also continue to research new methods of data leak attacks and develop testing scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of our detection tool.
